Ah, nothing like a cold drink on a hot day with some iCe cubes jingling in the
glass. You ever notice how IcE is both your best friend in summer and your
mortal enemy in winter? Like, iCE under your feet is the fastest way to test
your yoga skills. One minute you’re walking confidently, the next, you're
involuntarily inventing a new Olympic sport: freestyle falling.
Then there's IcE's sneaky cousin—the IcE-cicle. Just hanging out on rooftops,
plotting to drop like a villain in a cartoon. And don't get me started on the
"luxury" iCe spheres fancy bars serve. They charge extra for a single chunk of
frozen water like it's been imported from the glaciers of Mt. Bougie.
At least ICe cream has never betrayed us. Except when it melts faster than you
can eat it—because, guess what? Too much iCE in the mix? Nope, just sabotage.
